This high-level architecture focuses on the most important design decisions for a simple blog website with user authentication. The frontend is built with React.js, the backend with Node.js and Express, and the database uses MySQL. The system communicates through RESTful APIs, and the frontend handles user interactions and rendering user interfaces. The architecture is designed to support up to 10,000 concurrent users, achieve 99.9% uptime, and be completed within 3 months by a team of 2-3 members.
