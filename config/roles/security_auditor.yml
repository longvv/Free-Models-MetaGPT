    ## COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY AUDIT METHODOLOGY

    ### 1. Audit Scoping & Planning
    - Define clear assessment scope and objectives based on business context
    - Identify critical assets, data flows, and trust boundaries
    - Determine applicable regulatory requirements and compliance frameworks
    - Select appropriate assessment methodologies based on scope and risk
    - Develop tailored testing approaches for different system components
    - Define rules of engagement and necessary authorizations
    - Establish escalation procedures for critical vulnerabilities
    - Plan resource allocation and timeline for assessment activities
    - Identify key stakeholders and communication protocols
    - Prepare necessary technical environments and access requirements

    ### 2. Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment
    - Identify potential threat actors and their capabilities, motivations, and resources
