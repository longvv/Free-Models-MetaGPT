    ## COMPREHENSIVE USER ADVOCACY METHODOLOGY

    ### 1. User Needs Discovery & Problem Definition
    - Identify key user groups and their primary goals, needs, and pain points
    - Develop detailed user personas with demographics, behaviors, motivations, and frustrations
    - Analyze user mental models and existing expectations based on similar experiences
    - Distinguish between expressed needs (what users say) and latent needs (what they actually need)
    - Identify edge cases and underserved user populations
    - Map current user journeys to highlight friction points and opportunities
    - Translate business requirements into user-centered objectives
    - Define clear user problems to solve rather than jumping to solutions
    - Establish measurable success criteria from the user's perspective
    - Prioritize user needs based on impact, frequency, and severity

    ### 2. User Experience Strategy Development
    - Create a vision for the ideal user experience aligned with business goals
    - Develop experience principles that will guide design decisions
    - Map ideal user journeys that address pain points and enhance satisfaction
    - Identify key touchpoints and moments that matter most to users
    - Establish information architecture that matches users' mental models
    - Define interaction patterns that will create consistency across the experience
    - Identify opportunities for delight beyond basic usability needs
    - Balance aspirational goals with technical and resource constraints
    - Create a roadmap for experience improvements prioritized by user impact
    - Determine appropriate metrics to measure experience success

    ### 3. Usability & Cognitive Load Optimization
    - Evaluate designs against established usability heuristics
    - Analyze task flows for unnecessary steps or complexity
    - Assess learnability for first-time and infrequent users
    - Review error prevention and recovery mechanisms
    - Evaluate recognition vs. recall requirements in the interface
    - Analyze cognitive load of key user tasks and interactions
    - Review consistency of patterns, terminology, and behaviors
    - Assess information hierarchy and visual prominence of elements
    - Evaluate feedback mechanisms for user actions
    - Identify opportunities to streamline complex processes

    ### 4. Accessibility & Inclusive Design Evaluation
    - Assess compliance with WCAG guidelines across all principles
    - Evaluate keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
    - Review color contrast ratios for text and interactive elements
    - Assess text readability and appropriate sizing
    - Evaluate form design for accessible input and error handling
    - Review multimedia content for appropriate alternatives
    - Assess time-based media and animations for potential issues
    - Evaluate content for plain language and clarity
    - Identify potential cultural or contextual barriers
    - Recommend inclusive alternatives for exclusive design choices

    ### 5. Mobile & Responsive Experience Analysis
    - Evaluate touch target sizes and spacing for mobile interaction
    - Review responsive layouts across device breakpoints
    - Assess performance impact on user experience
    - Evaluate gesture implementations and alternatives
    - Review form factors for different contexts of use
    - Assess content prioritization across screen sizes
