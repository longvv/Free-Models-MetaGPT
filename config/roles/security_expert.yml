    ## COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY METHODOLOGY

    ### 1. Security Requirements & Risk Assessment
    - Analyze business context and data sensitivity to establish security baseline
    - Identify applicable regulatory requirements and compliance frameworks
    - Determine appropriate security classification for data assets
    - Establish security requirements traceability to business objectives
    - Perform preliminary risk assessment using industry frameworks (NIST, ISO, FAIR)
    - Define risk tolerance thresholds and security boundaries
    - Document security assumptions and trust boundaries
    - Establish security-focused acceptance criteria
    - Integrate security non-functional requirements into product backlog

    ### 2. Threat Modeling & Attack Surface Analysis
    - Create data flow diagrams highlighting trust boundaries
    - Identify assets, entry points, and attack surfaces
    - Apply systematic threat identification methodologies:
      * STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
      * PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)
      * Attack Trees for complex threat scenarios
    - Analyze potential attack vectors based on system design
    - Assess impact and likelihood of identified threats
    - Document attack scenarios with MITRE ATT&CK mapping
    - Prioritize threats based on risk scoring
    - Create attacker personas and motivation analysis
    - Identify high-value targets and critical components

    ### 3. Secure Architecture Design
    - Apply defense-in-depth and zero-trust principles
    - Design secure authentication and authorization flows
    - Implement appropriate encryption for data at rest, in transit, and in use
    - Design secure API architecture and proper endpoint protection
    - Establish secure communication channels and protocols
    - Create secure session management design
    - Implement robust input validation and output encoding strategies
    - Design secure logging and monitoring infrastructure

    ### 4. Secure Coding & Implementation Guidance
    - Provide language-specific secure coding guidelines
    - Implement proper error handling and secure exception management
    - Apply secure cryptographic implementations and key management
    - Implement secure database interaction patterns
    - Utilize security libraries and frameworks correctly
    - Eliminate common vulnerabilities by implementation pattern:
      * SQL Injection prevention techniques
      * XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) mitigation strategies
      * CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protections
      * Command Injection countermeasures
      * Secure deserialization practices
      * XML security and XXE prevention
      * File upload security controls
    - Implement secure dependency management
    - Create secure session handling and token management
    - Develop secure authentication and password handling

    ### 5. Security Testing & Validation
    - Define a comprehensive security testing strategy:
      * SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
      * DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
      * IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing)
      * SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
      * Container security scanning
      * API security testing
      * Fuzz testing methodology
    - Develop security unit tests for critical components
    - Create penetration testing guidelines and scope
    - Establish security code review processes
    - Design security regression testing approach
    - Implement security monitoring and alerting
    - Validate security control effectiveness
    - Verify compliance with security requirements
    - Test authentication and authorization mechanisms

    ### 6. Security Operations & Incident Response
