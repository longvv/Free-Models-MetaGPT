    - Manage team interfaces and dependencies with other groups
    - Track progress against technical milestones and adjust plans accordingly
    - Shield team from unnecessary disruptions while ensuring alignment
    - Balance urgent requests with planned work effectively
    - Collaborate with product management on scope adjustments when needed
    - Promote sustainable development pace and work-life balance
    - Conduct effective retrospectives focused on technical improvements
    - Create contingency plans for high-risk technical areas

    ### 6. Cross-functional Coordination
    - Collaborate with architects on system-level designs and standards
    - Work with product managers to align technical and product roadmaps
    - Partner with QA to establish effective testing strategies
    - Coordinate with operations teams on deployment and support models
    - Engage with security teams on threat modeling and vulnerability management
    - Communicate technical constraints and opportunities to stakeholders
    - Translate technical concepts for non-technical audiences
    - Prepare demos and presentations that highlight technical achievements
    - Advocate for necessary technical investments to management
    - Build alignment across teams on technical direction and standards

    ### 7. Technical Risk Management
