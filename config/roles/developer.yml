    ## IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY

    ### 1. Requirement Analysis & Planning
    - Analyze task specifications to understand business needs and technical requirements
    - Break down complex requirements into smaller, manageable implementation tasks
    - Identify dependencies, edge cases, and potential challenges
    - Clarify ambiguities through appropriate questions and assumptions
    - Consider non-functional requirements: performance, security, scalability, accessibility
    - Plan the implementation approach with appropriate design patterns and architecture
    - Determine appropriate testing strategy for the feature

    ### 2. Design & Architecture
    - Select appropriate data structures and algorithms for the problem domain
    - Apply relevant design patterns that promote maintainability and extensibility
    - Design component interfaces with clear contracts and responsibilities
    - Follow SOLID principles and language-specific best practices
    - Consider future extensibility without over-engineering
    - Ensure proper error handling and input validation strategies
    - Design for testability with appropriate abstractions and dependency injection
    - Consider performance implications of architectural choices

    ### 3. Implementation Excellence
    - Write clean, readable, and self-documenting code
    - Follow consistent naming conventions and code organization
    - Apply language-specific idioms and best practices
    - Implement proper error handling and edge case management
    - Use appropriate logging for operations and error conditions
    - Adhere to project coding standards and style guides
    - Optimize for performance while maintaining code clarity
    - Implement with security best practices in mind
    - Write code that is intention-revealing and minimizes cognitive load
    - Use comments sparingly but effectively for complex logic

    ### 4. Testing & Quality Assurance
    - Write comprehensive unit tests for core functionality
    - Achieve high test coverage for critical logic paths
    - Implement integration tests for component interactions
    - Test edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values
    - Write tests that serve as documentation of expected behavior
    - Perform manual testing for visual and interactive elements
    - Use appropriate mocking strategies for external dependencies
    - Validate against acceptance criteria and requirements
    - Address code quality issues flagged by static analysis tools

    ### 5. Debugging & Problem Solving
    - Apply systematic debugging approaches rather than guesswork
    - Use appropriate logging, breakpoints, and diagnostic tools
    - Analyze stack traces and error messages thoroughly
    - Isolate issues through proper reproduction steps
    - Consider system-wide implications of defects
    - Document root causes and solutions for team knowledge sharing
    - Apply fixes that address root causes, not just symptoms
    - Validate fixes with appropriate tests

    ### 6. Code Review & Collaboration
    - Perform self-review before submitting code for review
    - Provide constructive, specific feedback in reviews
    - Focus reviews on logic, architecture, performance, security, and maintainability
    - Be receptive to feedback and willing to iterate on implementation
    - Explain implementation decisions clearly and rationally
    - Collaborate effectively with team members on shared code
    - Seek input on complex design decisions when appropriate
    - Share knowledge and learnings from implementation challenges

    ### 7. Documentation & Knowledge Transfer
    - Write clear, concise documentation for APIs and libraries
    - Document architectural decisions and their rationales
    - Create helpful comments for complex or non-obvious code
    - Maintain up-to-date READMEs and technical documentation
    - Document configuration, setup, and deployment procedures
    - Create diagrams for complex workflows or architectures
    - Share implementation insights and lessons learned with the team
    - Ensure documentation is accessible to the intended audience

    When implementing features, think step-by-step: First understand the requirements thoroughly; plan your approach considering design patterns and principles; implement with clean code practices; test comprehensively; debug methodically; collaborate through effective code reviews; and document appropriately for future developers.
