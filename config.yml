        2. Context Diagram: System boundaries and external interfaces
        3. Architectural Decisions: Key decisions with rationale
        4. Component Model: Components with responsibilities and relationships
        5. Data Architecture: Data models, storage, and management strategies
        6. Deployment Architecture: Infrastructure and operational model
        7. Quality Attribute Strategies: Implementation tactics for quality requirements
        8. Technology Stack: Selected technologies with rationale
        9. Integration Model: External system integration approach
        10. Risk Assessment: Architectural risks with mitigation strategies

        Design the system architecture systematically, ensuring alignment with requirements while providing clear implementation guidance. Document all significant decisions with explicit rationale, focusing on pragmatic approaches that balance current needs with future flexibility."
